A package to provide a value checker mechanism.
The `ValueChecker` consists of three parts.

`ExceptionComposer`:: An interface to compose appropriate exceptions from a given message.
`MessageComposer`:: An interface to compose appropriate messages for various purposes.
`ReportComposer`:: An interface to compose a report for a given failure.

These are designed replaceable independently.
