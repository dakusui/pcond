This package collects entry point classes of the `thincrest` library.
Do `static import` for a class that you want to use.

For test assertions:: If you are using this library as an "assertion" library instead of Hamcrest, AssertJ, or Google Truth, the class to do `static import` is `TestAssertions`.

For all of these, you want to do also `static import` classes under `forms` package, such as `Functions` and `Predicates`.
