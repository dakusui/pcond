:pcond-version: 1.4.0

= Quick Start

`pcond` is a library that allows you to write a program in the "Design by Contract"<<DbC>> style.
Not only that, it gives a very informative message when a check you defined fails.

Unlike `Guava` 's `Preconditions` class<<GuavaPreconditions>>, you do not need to repeat the same fact both in Java for the actual check and in a natural language of yours for the message on its failure.
Unlike `valid4j`<<v4j>>, it provides a set of human-readable predicates, which can be used as normal `java.util.function.Predicate` s instead of depending on `hamcrest` library.

== Installation

Have a following maven dependency in your `pom.xml`.

[source,xml]
[subs="verbatim,attributes"]

  <artifactId>pcond</artifactId>
  <version>{pcond-version}</version>
</dependency>

== Getting started

Following is the first example of the `pcond` library.

[source,java]
.Example.java
----
package com.github.dakusui.pcond.examples;

// <1>
import static com.github.dakusui.pcond.Assertions.precondition;
import static com.github.dakusui.pcond.Postconditions.ensureNonNull;
import static com.github.dakusui.pcond.Preconditions.requireArgument;
import static com.github.dakusui.pcond.functions.Functions.*;
import static com.github.dakusui.pcond.functions.Predicates.*;

public class Example {
  public static String hello(String yourName) {
    // <2>
    requireArgument(yourName, and(isNotNull(), transform(length()).check(gt(0)), containsString(" ")));
    String ret = String.format("Hello, %s", firstNameOf(yourName));
    // <3>
    return ensureNonNull(ret);
  }

  private static String firstNameOf(String yourName) {
    // <4>
    assert precondition(yourName, containsString(" "));
    return yourName.substring(0, yourName.indexOf(' '));
  }

  public static void main(String[] args) {
    System.out.println(hello("JohnDoe"));
  }
}
----
<1> Import entry points statically.
<2> In order to require *your user* satisfy a certain condition on an input, use `requireXyz` methods in `Preconditions` class.
<3> In order to ensure *your library* satisfies a certain condition on an output, use `ensureXyz` methods in `Postconditions` class.
<4> If a certain value does not satisfy a certain condition, and it will be your own bug, (neither your user's nor a third party library,) use `assert` with a predicate built with methods in `Predicates` and `Functions`.

This results in a following output.

[source]
.Output of Example.java
----
Exception in thread "main" java.lang.IllegalArgumentException: value:"JohnDoe" violated precondition:value ((isNotNull&&!isEmpty)&&containsString[" "])
"JohnDoe" -> &&                    ->       false
               &&                  ->     true
                 isNotNull         ->   true
                 =>                ->   true
                   length          -> 7
7         ->       >[0]            -> true
"JohnDoe" ->   containsString[" "] ->     false
	at com.github.dakusui.pcond.provider.impls.DefaultAssertionProvider.checkValue...
	at ...
----

You can see the violated condition and how it is violated in the stacktrace.

=== Writing the code

To verify a value with `pcond`, you can call an entry point method of `pcond` with your value and a predicate to be checked.

[source]
----
entryPointMethod(aValue, predicate);
----

Checking methods are defined in the entry point classes, which are `Assertions`, `Postconditions`, and `Preconditions`.
It is recommended to import them statically at the beginning of your class.

You can give your own lambda as a predicate to the method, however it will result in non-user friendly string such as following.

[source]
----
Exception in thread "main" java.lang.IllegalArgumentException: value:"JohnDoe" violated precondition:value java.util.function.Predicate$$Lambda$78/2047329716@46f7f36a
----

This is still better than nothing, however, probably it will be much better if you can see what a condition the value "JohnDoe" violated and how it did without visiting the source code.
In order to make `pcond` print such a message on a failure, you need to give a "printable" predicate, which we will be describing here.

==== Building a "Printable" Predicate

`pcond` offers a set of method to create a printable predicate in `Predicates` class.
It also offers a way to construct a conjuntion, disjunction, and negation of given printable predicates.

Following is an example.

----
and(isNotNull(), transform(length()).check(gt(0)), containsString(" "))
----

`isNotNull` is a method that returns a predicate which returns `true` if a value given to `test` method is not `null`.
And its `toString` method is overridden so that it returns a string `isNotNull`.

`and` is another method that returns a printable predicate.
The method accepts predicates and constructs a new printable predicate that is a conjunction of them.

`transform` and `check` structure needs a bit more explanation than others.

----
transform(length()).check(gt(0))
----

This line constructs a printable predicate which returns true if a length of a given string is greater than (`gt`) 0.

NOTE: This is a bit artificial example to illustrate the usage of the `transform` and `check` structure.
You can achieve the same thing with `Predicates.isEmptyString()` and it will be simpler and faster.

First the method `transfom` accepts, preferably a printable, function.
In this case a function returned by `length` method, which is defined in `Functions` class, is passed to the method.
Now it returns a factory for a printable predicate.
The `check` method of the factory returns a new predicate that checks a transformed value by the first function.
With this `transform` and `check` approach, you can build various printable predicates from preset ones.

==== Examining a value

Depending on the context, where you are going to examine a given value, an appropriate message and exception to be thrown on a failure can be different.
`pcond` provides methods that offer such messages and exceptions.
You can simply call methods with the value and the condition you are going to examine.
Followings are methods for it and classes in which they are defined.

`requireXyz` (`Preconditions`):: Methods for checking "preconditions", which a user of your product needs to satisfy.
On a failure, a `RuntimeException` such as `NullPointerException` etc. will be thrown depending on the actual method.
`Xyz` can be `NonNull`, `Argument`, or `State`.
`ensureXyz` (`Postconditions`):: Methods for checking "postconditions" , which your product needs to satisfy for its user.
These methods also throw `RuntimeException` s depending on a actual prefix `Xyz` .
`Xyz` can be `NonNull` or `State`.
`validate` (`Validations`):: This is also used for checking "preconditions".
However, unlike `requireXyz` methods, it throws an `ApplicationException`, which is a checked exception (not a `RuntimeException`).
This method should be used in a situation where a "recoverable" failure happens.
`assert xyz` (`Assertions`):: This should be used for checking "internal" error, where you want to disable the check in production code.
`xyz` can be `precondition`, `postcondition`, `invariant` and `that`.
The usege of the first three is self-explanatory.
`that` is used for the other purposes.
In case you want to use `assert` for any other purposes than them, use `that`.

To check your user's fault, use `requireXyz` or `validate`.
When there is a simple and easy way to check the condition, use `requireXyz`.
Otherwise, use `validate` to allow your user to handle the error.
To check your own fault, use `ensureXyz` or `assert xyz`.
If the check should be done even in the production, i.e. it can be broken by your user, use `ensureXyz`.
Otherwise, use `assert xyz`.
Because the check can only be broken by your own fault (bug), which should not exist in your production code.

Among all of those, `assert xyz` has a quite outstanding characteristic, where it can be completely disabled by `-da` option to your JVM and does not have any performance overhead at all if it is disabled.

=== Reading the output

Look at the first line.
There's a message:

----
value:"JohnDoe" violated precondition:value ((isNotNull&&!isEmpty)&&containsString[" "])
----

This is describing the value that was examined and the condition violated by it.

The next several lines explain how a given value violated a condition to be satisfied.

----
"JohnDoe" -> &&                    ->       false
               &&                  ->     true
                 isNotNull         ->   true
                 !                 ->   true
                   isEmpty         -> false
               containsString[" "] ->     false
----

See the last line, this means the given string `JohnDoe` made a condition `containsString[" "]` `false` and it made the entire check fail.
`pcond` is designed to shortcur an evaluation as soon as a value of a disjunctive or conjunctive predicate becomes fixed.
That is if you have an `or` condition and the first predicate under it becomes `true`, the rest will not be evaluated at all.
So the last line in the message always shows the direct reason why the check failed.

Thus, you can read the output above as "The check failed because the value `\"JohnDoe\"` `containsString[" "]` was `false`.
"
