== Usage

First, let's import statically entry points of the library in your code.

Of course, you can rely on your IDE for it, though.


=== `assert var != null` vs `Objects.requireNonNull(var)`

What are the differences between them?
For what a situation do you use `assert` or `requireNonNull`?

`assert` throws `java.lang.AssertionError` and for `requireNonNull`, `java.lang.NullPointerException` is thrown, when the `var` is `null`.
And, in both cases, we consider that a bug is detected and the exception should not be caught.

Then which should be used when?

The policy `pcond` takes is as simple as follows,

- When you are detecting a bug of your own library, use `assert var != null`.
- When you are detecting a bug of your client's, use `requireNonNull(var)`

The former should be used in `private` or package-private methods in general, and the other, in `public` methods.

public class Example {
  public void publicMethod(String message) {
    requireNonNull(message);
    privateMethod(message);
  }

  private void privateMethod(String message) {
    assert precondition(message, isNotNull());
    System.out.println(mesage);
  }
}

=== Descriptiveness on failure.

(t.b.d.)

=== Performance

The `precondition` method is defined to return a `boolean` value.
