= The `pcond` library

`pcond` is a library to build "printable" predicates.

== Background: Writing Assertions isn't Fun

Any existing way to write assertions in Java isn't fun.

Why do I need to memorize appropriate static methods scattered in various matcher classes?
Why do I need to write custom support for my own class every time?
How should I write multiple conditions to be checked in one test method?

In short, why can't we make our test codes as cool as product's code?

To track the root cause, it will in the end

== Key Concepts

* Transform-and-Check Programming Model
* Printable Predicates
* Entry-points: `Predicates`, `Functions`, and `Printables`
  ** `isEqualTo` (`Predicates`)
  ** `call` (`Functions`)
* Fluent API to build printable predicates
